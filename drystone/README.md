**Drystone Cost Calculator**

This application allows the user to calculate the cost of a drystone wall, by meter squared. With a focus on an easy to use user-interface, simply add the height and length, in meters.

During the pricing, the app will show three estimates, low, average and high. We can break down the estimates in the following way. 

- Low: This pricing assumes the least expensive stone inc. delivery and also assumes the cheapest wage of a Stonemason. Thus it could be considered to be representative of reclaimed or field stone, in a low income area.
- Average: This pricing assumes the average price of selected stone inc. delivery and also assumes the average wage of a Stonemason. Thus it could be considered to be representative of selected sandstone, in an area of average affluence.
- High: This pricing assumes the higher range of cost, for stone inc. delivery, and also assumes the highest end of a Stonemasons wage. Thus it could be considered to be representative of luxury stone types, in a high income area (Such as the south of England)

### Constraints
---

This app only accepts heights in the range of 0.5m - 1.65m, this is in accordance with industry standards.

This app only accepts length in the range of 1m - 1000m, this was considered to be the maximum and minimum values that offered relevance to the user.

Future functionality being considered includes:

- Spinning up an Express server and Database, to store cookies of previous quotes.
- Allowing the User to mix and match stone price ranges, with labour price ranges.
